* README
  Script that sets up a webpage to make it easier to manually check
  classified text.

* How to use

  Right now, the program is not very general and made specifically for
  one purpose. What it does is that in =setup()= it loads all the
  articles that match a search into memory. It then serves those
  sequentially to the user who presses save or just next.

  Each page has the search terms marked in =mark_search_words()=.

* Requirements

  - Python3
    - Flask
  - SQLite3 (With full-text search (FTS) enabled )


  SQLite3 can be built with fts using homebrew if you are on a mac or
  from source.
